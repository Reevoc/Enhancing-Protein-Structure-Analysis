# Enhancing Protein Structure Analysis 
## Introduction
The Residue Interaction Network Generator (RING) and Ribbon Diagrams have revolutionized the study of protein structures, enabling researchers to delve into the intricate details of residue interactions.
The aim of this powerfull tool in the field of structural biology is to provide a simple and intuitive way to visualize the interactions between residues in a protein structure.
In our case we are going to develop a software that will be able to predict the interactions between residues in a protein structure, given a dataset of protein structures and its corresponding interactions.

## Dataset
The first look of the project were given to datasets provided to understand the problem and the data. The datasets provide different type of geometrical information about the protein structures. We are going to summarize in brief:
